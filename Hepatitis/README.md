# About Dataset
Dataset of a Hepatitis patient live or death 

## Overview of the dataset:

About the hepatitis database and BILIRUBIN problem I would like to say the following: BILIRUBIN is continuous attribute (= the number of it's "values" in the ASDOHEPA.DAT file is negative!!!); "values" are quoted because when speaking about the continuous attribute there is no such thing as all possible values. However, they represent so called "boundary" values; according to these "boundary" values the attribute can be discretized. At the same time, because of the continious attribute, one can perform some other test since the continuous information is preserved.
